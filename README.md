# mangoshop
This project implements a web application for mango shop, developed with
PHP (backend), HTML, CSS and JavaScript ( frontend), and MySQL
(database). It supports role-based access with Admin and farmer logins, and
includes a farmer registration system. Admin authentication provides access
to a dashboard displaying new requests and form submissions. The database
efficiently manages mango related data, while the frontend ensures a
responsive and interactive user experience.
